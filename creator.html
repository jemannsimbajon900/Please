    <h2>The Creators</h2>

    <p><strong>Batman</strong> was created in 1939 by <strong>Bob Kane</strong> and <strong>Bill Finger</strong>.</p>

    <p>Over the decades, many legendary writers and artists shaped the Batman mythos, including Frank Miller, Scott Snyder, Greg Capullo, Jeph Loeb, and many more.</p>

    <p>In the late 1930s, Kane was hired by Detective Comics (which would eventually be known as DC Comics) and was tasked with creating a new superhero to compete with the success of Superman, who had debuted in Action Comics #1 in 1938. Kane came up with the initial design and concept for Batman.</p>

    <h2>DC Comics</h2>

    <p>When Batman was created in 1939, Bob Kane and Bill Finger were working for Detective Comics, Inc., which would later be known as DC Comics. Batman first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. In 1967, DC Comics became part of Warner Bros through the acquisition of its parent company, National Periodical Publications.</p>

    <p>Kane is credited with coming up with the basic concept of a caped crusader who fought crime in Gotham City. He designed Batman's initial look, including the costume, the bat-like cowl, and the overall appearance.</p>

    <p>The company asked artists to come up with another superhero to capture that same excitement. Bob Kane created the original idea and concept, but Bill Finger suggested many of the defining elements we recognize today, including the darker costume, the tone, and Batman’s tragic upbringing.</p>

    <h2>Bob Kane’s Motivation</h2>

    <p>Bob Kane drew inspiration from characters such as Zorro, who featured a masked hero leading a double life. He was also influenced by The Shadow, Leonardo da Vinci’s bat-wing glider sketches, and the film <em>The Bat Whispers</em>. Kane was additionally motivated by the success of Superman and wanted to create a hero without superpowers who could exist in the real world.</p>

    <h2>After Batman’s Success</h2>

    <p>Kane was officially credited as Batman’s sole creator for many years, while Bill Finger’s contributions went largely unrecognized. DC Comics later officially acknowledged Bill Finger as co-creator. Finger passed away in January 1974 without receiving significant royalties during his lifetime.</p>
